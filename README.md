# Let the games begin!

From 2017 to 2021, I worked as a head TA for *COMP30024 Artificial
Intellience*, an introductory AI class at the University of Melbourne.

Each year, I develop an original board game for the students to play. Well,
it's for their computers to play: As a semester project, the students work
in pairs to create a Python program capable of playing the board game.

We typically provide an online *battleground server* for the students to
compete through without sharing code, and we also run an offline tournament
at the end of the semester to find out which team has created the most adept
program.

This repository documents the games and projects themselves.
Contact me to discuss a license (probably free for use in teaching).

## Rock-Paper-Scissors 360

In 2021, we will play *Rock--Paper--Scissors 360*, a simultaneous-play board
game inspired by the classic game of chance and anticipation. I'm still
developing the details, and will update this repository after the semester.

## Expendibots

> *Expendibots* is a fast paced action game where assembling and
> disassembling powerful stacks of bots will be the key to your survival.
> Sneak behind enemy lines and cause chain reactions to do huge damage,
> but watch out for friendly fire!
> Can you successfully fend off your opponent's attacks and emerge
> victorious?

In 2020, as I completed an exchange semester when I would normally be
teaching COMP30024. Over summer, I teamed up with my replacement head TA
Adam Kues to design and implement *Expendibots*, one of our most dynamic,
challenging, and exciting AI games since my first semester.

* TODO: With Adam's permission, add rules, specs, and BOOM protocol server.


## Chexers

> Chexers is a three-player hexagonal turn-based race game.
> Test the loyalty of your band of two-faced checkerpieces as you charge
> them through a twisting and treacherous battleground.
> Will all your pieces stay true to your cause?
> Can you earn yourself some new followers in the chaos?
> To win this tumultuous chase, you must double-cross and triple-cross your
> way across the finish line before your opponents---three, two, one... go!

In 2019, we played *Chexers*, a three-player hexagonal board game where
players can capture the pieces of their opponent as they race across the
board.

* TODO: Add Chexers animation
* TODO: Add the rules of the game of *Chexers*
* TODO: Add the Python implementation and interface
* TODO: Add the project specifications
* TODO: Add the C hex protocol server and code.

## Watch Your Back!

In 2018, we played *Watch Your Back!*, a two-player board game based loosely
on the ancient
[Ludus latruncolorum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ludus_latrunculorum).

* TODO:
  The details of the game are somewhere... I might have to do a little digging
  to find them.

## Slider

In 2017, we played *Slider*, a two-player race and blocking game. I did not
design this game, but it served as an inspiration for *Chexers* of 2019 (see
below).

* TODO: Add some files and details about Slider.

## Hexifence

In 2016, I was not the TA for COMP30024, in fact I was one of its students.
The game this year was *Hexifence*, a hexagonal variant of the pen-and-paper
game [Dots and Boxes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dots_and_Boxes), and the
project was completed in Java.

I worked with my project partner Julian Tran to develop a program using basic
adversarial search techniques, some specialised game tactics ('double boxing')
and a high-level represetation of the board (chunking the board into
tactically-relevant 'chains' rather than searching over individual edges).
With our high-level representation, we were able to obtain excellent search
depth and to out-perform our cohort.

* TODO: Link to files
